Our team decided to redesign the Wikipedia website with a more user-focused design, argeted towards its wide range of users. We decided to go with a simple, yet esthetically stimulating look for the home page. We chose an image similar in nature to the original logo of the page (a globe), yet bolder and more visually attractive. The backgound image covers the entirety of the page, in keeping with the global theme.

The home page also employs a RESTful API which uses voice recognition technology to allow the user to select their language of choice verbally.

For the main page, we decided to keep the Wikipedia tradition of simplicity, but format the infomation in a more easily consumed and accessible way. Instead on large blocks of small-font text, we decided to employ moderately spaced blocks of text which include an image. The reader is exposed to a small snipet of the text, and given the option to "read more" via hyperlink. This allows the reader's eye to separate each block of text, allowing them to easily locate the information they are searching for. This is especially important to the goal of our user; the person looking to find specific information about an obscure topic, with not much time to spare, whether that is due to need or intrest.  Simplicity breeds efficiency.

### Backend

  The app is run using the node library. It uses the middleware linked to the Log In page to connect to the database of member profiles.

### Installation
  In order to install the app:
  1. run the terminal command `npm install`. This installs the node modules needed to run the app. 
  2. `npm start` in your terminal will make the app appear on your machine's local host.
